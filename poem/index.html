      I yearn this year for a Yankee fall: the rise
      Of nature on her pathway to demise;
      The plaster walls of this shadowed city room
      Are shutting out the air and in the gloom.


      I want a russet season, jewel hued
      A ride on a wagon piled high with hay
      A paper cup of cider, freshly brewed
      A jack-o-lantern carved in orange clay


      A sapling glowing bright with yellow leaves
      A crate of shiny apples from a farm
      A cozy sweater, red, with cabled sleeves
      A patchwork scarecrow with a crooked arm


      A field of auburn pumpkins laced with dew
      A woolen hat with a faded brim, careworn
      A steaming bowl of beef-and-barley stew
      A hefty bag of treacly candy corn
      
      
      The scent of dying leaves and rain-damp dirt
      The crunch of boots across thick forest floors
      The warmth inside a fuzzy flannel shirt
      The taste of cocoa sweetening as it pours


      A donut from a farmstand by the road
      A candle in a jar adorned with moons
      A ghoul costume craftily hand-sewed
      A bright bouquet of carnival balloons
      
      
      A field of kilts and a hockey game well played
      The crispness of a breeze from east-south-east
      A kindergarten Halloween parade
      The stuffing at a family turkey feast
      
      
      I want to sit on the porch of my old house
      And watch the sun dissolve behind the trees
      Then put on corduroys and a buttoned blouse
      And walk while the thinning air begins to freeze
      
      
      Recalling rusty autumns past, in which 
      This urban light had not begun to burn,
      Wondering where the button is, the switch
      To flip the globe a counterclockwise turn.


      Contrary to the popular belief,
      This season is a master of disguise:
      In autumn, nature dons the garb of grief
      And burns with splendor just before she dies.
